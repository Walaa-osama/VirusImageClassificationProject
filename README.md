# VirusImageClassificationProject
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on virus image classification using three advanced models: 
1- ResNet Implementation from Scratch 
2-Xception Fine-tuning 
3-DenseNet Fine-tuning
Models:
1. ResNet Implementation from Scratch
Description: This model implements the ResNet architecture from the ground up, utilizing residual connections to combat the vanishing gradient problem.
Key Features:
   -Custom implementation allows for a deeper understanding of the architecture.
   -Residual blocks enable training of very deep networks effectively.
   -Suitable for image classification tasks with complex features.
2. Xception Fine-tuning
Description: Xception is an extension of the Inception model, which replaces standard Inception modules with depthwise separable convolutions. This model is fine-tuned on the virus image dataset.
Key Features:
   -Pre-trained on a large dataset, allowing for transfer learning.
   -Fine-tuning enhances model performance on specific tasks.
   -Efficient architecture that reduces the number of parameters while maintaining accuracy.
3. DenseNet Fine-tuning
Description: DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, which improves gradient flow and feature reuse. This model is also fine-tuned for the virus classification task.
Key Features:
   -Each layer receives direct supervision from the loss function, improving learning.
   -Reduces the number of parameters compared to traditional CNNs.
   -Excellent performance on image classification tasks due to its dense connectivity.
